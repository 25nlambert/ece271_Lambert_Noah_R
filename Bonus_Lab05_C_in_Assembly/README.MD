Bonus Lab #5, Calling C functions from Assembly

Lab Demo
-----------
Your answer: 
Displaying how many times the button has been pressed on the OLED display

Another .c file was created that held two functions. One for initialization of the OLED display and one for 
the counter functionality of the program.

The assembly code has LED functionality to provide a visual when a button press has been detected.
The program looks for a button press and release before counting it as a press. The LED will toggle
and then call the counter function that adds 1 to the count_hold variable and displays it on the screen.
The loop then resets and waits for a button press.
