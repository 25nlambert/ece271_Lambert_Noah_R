##  Lab Report ##

What is something cool you did in this lab?
-----------
Your answer: I added a "debug" mode that adds more information to the OLED. This information includes the current loop that the
motor sequence is on, the most recently pressed column, and most recently pressed row. This debug mode can be accessed by entering
the passcode "654321" which is set in the program. My code also adds the ability to turn the stepper motor when the correct 
passcode is entered (123456). 

Post-lab Questions
-------

* Answers to Question 1: Our algorithm can detect all the keys pressed when pressed up until more than 2 keys have been pressed.
After this point the keys pressed have the possiblity that multiple key presses could produce a circuit that is identical to the 
STM32 board where it wouldn't be able to differentiate between the two.
