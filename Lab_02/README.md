##  Lab Report ##

What is something cool you did in this lab?
-----------
Your answer: I used the OLED display originally used for lab 3 to display the amount of times the program has looped through a motor 
sequence. The display also displays the current angle of the motor below it. 


Post-lab Questions

* Answers to Question 1: 
I could use mosfets with a external power supply to provide more current than a Darlington
array can provide.

* Answers to Question 2: 
Yes, it is possible to rotate the motor less than a half step, it is possible all the way down to 
1/32 of a full step using pulse width modulation (PWM) to use a micro-stepping sequence for motor rotation.
